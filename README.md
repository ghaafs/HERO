# Health Economics Modelling
This repository contains a **cost-effectiveness modelling** simulation built with **Python** and deployed using **Streamlit**.  
It serves as a portfolio project to demonstrate analytical, modelling, and visualization skills for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This interactive app simulates a **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** comparing two hypothetical treatments.  
The model estimates **incremental costs**, **incremental QALYs**, and the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**.  

It allows users to:
- Adjust model parameters (costs, QALY gains, patient population size)
- Run real-time CEA calculations
- Visualize results on a **cost-effectiveness plane**
- Understand the trade-offs between cost and health outcomes

**âš  Disclaimer:**  
This is a **demonstration project** using synthetic data.  
No real patient data is included, and results are not intended for clinical decision-making.
